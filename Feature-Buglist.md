1. Scannable Undo should be on the screen and available, as well as the undo button. (Possibly integrate the two)
2. Code is getting long, should see about splitting out the CSS from the actual code once interface changes stablize.
3. The live activity list box under the buffer list, should just also print that the item is in the buffer alreaedy, instead of just looking like it's just continuing to add the same item over and over again. Keep the toast, but last update should also reflect that it was already scanned into the buffer.
4. undo when working with a active buffer/container should remove the last item added
5. toasts hould be a bit larger, and more prominate, maybe center of the screen?
6. items added to a toolhead are not being added to the toolhead in filabridge
7. Way to resync filabridge & spoolman current state into the command center, for changes done outside of the command center. possibly just incorperate in regular actions, or schedule it?
8. still not prompting for MDB container location when assigning to a multislot dryer box
9. make items in buffer larger
10. still missing logic for assigning items from a MDB to a toolhead. (QR Code for slot assignments?)
