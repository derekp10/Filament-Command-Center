I also don't want anymore of this, Forgetting and dropping sections of the code. If you aren't sure, always reference the source. If you are removing and modifying things that ARE NOT RELATED TO THE CURRENT TASK, DO NOT DO IT!!! OR at least ask for permission to do something that could break the code. And then Unit Test and revision the fuck out of it until it does work. 

I need you to start and always treat this code very carefully. I can't modify this as it's out of my coding ability, because of the types of languages used and the frameworks being used. If you see something that might need to be optimized, or rewritten to work better, ask and explain it to me, and then get my permission to do so. I don't want to see anymore of the work we got done and working, just disappearing because you forgot to include, or refactored it, or were working on a duplicate similar function unrelated to the one we were just working on.

Lets work on different aspects of code, one at a time. Say, if we need to do styles changes and scripts changes. Will work on one first, spit the code out for me to input. I'll let you know when I've done that, and then put your full attention on the other portion to implement the items based on what is already known about what was already done. I think we keep running out of context window because we have 2 huge code files being worked on at the same time.
