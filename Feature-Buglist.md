# **New and Unsorted Features/Bugs**


*(L4 — `[PRIORITY] Test-sweep flake stabilization` — DONE 2026-05-12 via Group 14. Sweep: 809 passed / 0 failed / 0 errors / 15 skipped. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

*(L6 — Details modal pops up after editing from global search — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session A (item 10.11). `openEditWizard` and `openCloneWizard` now only set a return-id when a spool/filament details modal is actually visible at launch. See `completed-archive.md`.)*


*(L17 — `[RECURRING] Modal / overlay Z-ordering` — DONE 2026-05-11 via Group 15. `window.mountOverlay()` is now the canonical helper; 5 inline overlays migrated; symptom checklist + z-index ladder documented in CLAUDE.md "Project Conventions". See `completed-archive.md`.)*


*(L37 — `[RECURRING] data/locations.json corruption` — PARTIAL 2026-05-12. Hardening (1) per-call temp filename + (2) verify-after-write tripwire shipped on `feature/locations-json-write-hardening`. Monitor prod hub.log for `verify-after-write FAILED` critical lines; (3) explicit truncate and (4) Docker named volume deferred pending recurrence signal. See `completed-archive.md`.)*




* Keeping the screen on when afk, still causes the screen to blank out. Confirmed on laptop, not on desktop. _[ON HOLD — OS-level power management, not fixable in app code. Candidate mitigations if we care: Wake Lock API (`navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')`) gated behind a toggle in the nav bar; only works when the tab is foreground. Worth considering if we add a kiosk/shop-floor mode.]_
* Config button, for configuing certain things in the system without having to edit a config file manually in a text editor. **Decision: Full-schema design first.** The architecture must be extensible so adding new configurable items "just works" without code changes to the config UI itself. The schema should be self-describing (key, label, type, default, section, validation rules) so the UI can render any new entry automatically. This will pull in the "Make as much of Command Center user configurable as possible" item. When we sit down for design: define the schema format, config storage (JSON file vs. DB table), import/export format, and a section hierarchy. _[NEEDS DESIGN SESSION — schedule a dedicated design discussion before any code starts.]_

* Filabridge status light is still blinking on and of, just more eraticly now. Need to look into this further. _[ON HOLD — hardware/firmware on the filabridge device itself. Not actionable from this repo until we can instrument the device side or get a usage log with timestamps correlated to filabridge-side network events.]_


* Check why FIL:58 wasn't marked as labeled when scanned. The `label_printed` field was retired in M7 and replaced with `needs_label_print` (boolean) — barcode-scan path now updates this field at `app.py:921-922, 968-969`. The FIL:58 case specifically needs manual repro to see whether the update fires and why Activity Log was silent. Could be because FIL:58 is an old physical swatch with no prior spoolman state. _[ON HOLD — need to locate or reprint the FIL:58 physical label/swatch before repro can be attempted. When found: scan with DevTools open → Network tab → `/api/identify_scan` response + Activity Log ticker.]_


* Sub-bug: "Display modal on Display modal" — suspect this is the filament→spool chain at [inv_details.js:304](inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_details.js#L304) interacting with the silent-refresh paths at lines 386/395. Needs its own reproduction trace before fixing. _[PARTIAL FIX 2026-05-12 (Group 8.3 / `feature/keyboard-nav-polish`) — `openSpoolDetails` and `openFilamentDetails` now route through `_hideSiblingDetailsModal` at function entry, which forcibly closes the sibling details modal (with a 400ms retry to defeat BS5's mid-fade-in `.hide()` ignore). The silent-refresh path (`silent=true`) is intentionally exempt so sync-pulse only repaints the active modal. Covers details↔details stacking. Wizard↔details stacking (Derek's 2026-04-29 repro) is a separate path and remains open — needs the same sibling-close pattern at wizard entry points + tracing for the leftover `state.processing` lock-up at L22.]_

* An unknow issue caused the frontend to lock up, causing it to no longer update to take barcodes. A hard refresh (Control shift R and Control F5) fixed it. We need to figure out what caused this, and fix it so it doesn't happen again. This could be related to the eject button issue above. Also seemed to have cause updates to filabridge to stop until the front end was refreshed. _[RECURRED 2026-04-29 — now believed to be the same root cause as the "Display modal on Display modal" bug at L20. Derek observed the crash twice when the details modal and the Add/Edit Wizard were both open. Likely a modal-on-modal race condition (e.g. wizard open fires while details modal's silent-refresh is mid-flight → unhandled promise rejection → `state.processing` stuck true → all barcode input and FilaBridge updates freeze). Next occurrence: DON'T hard-refresh first. Open DevTools → Console and Network tabs, screenshot pending XHRs and any red errors, then refresh.]_




* Need to do something about the fact that if a toolhead has multiple slots assigned to it for a dryer box, that new spool assignments don't automatically take over the current toolhead's assigned spool. **Decision: (c) Leave it to the user via Quick-Swap.** Intent is ambiguous — a new spool landing in a shared box may not mean the user wants to switch the active toolhead assignment (e.g., staging spools for later). Quick-Swap is the deliberate, explicit action for swapping. No auto-switch or auto-prompt. _[RESOLVED — no code change needed.]_

*(L32 — `PRINTER:<id>` sentinel for printer-pool slot binding — DONE 2026-05-13 via Group 9.2. All four sub-items complete; Quick-Swap grid now renders a "🏭 Printer Pool" banner row for sentinel slots with deposit-flow handoff. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

*(L37/L39 — Default-Unassigned + location selector "Flow" cleanup — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session A (items 10.3 + 10.2). Wizard combobox now shows full list on focus, highlights current selection, and placeholder advertises Unassigned default. See `completed-archive.md`.)*


*(L40 — Legacy QR code scans triggering the help overlay — DONE 2026-05-14 via `feature/buglist-sweep-2026-05-14`. `shortcuts_registry.js` capture-phase `?` handler now detects an in-flight scan (non-empty `state.scanBuffer` + `state.scanStartTime` within 500ms) and lets `?` flow through to the scan accumulator instead of popping the overlay. Regression coverage in `test_quickswap_ui_e2e.py::test_shortcuts_overlay_question_mark_mid_scan_does_not_trigger`.)*

*(L42 — Version number stale — DONE 2026-05-14 via `feature/buglist-sweep-2026-05-14`. Replaced hardcoded `VERSION = "v154.26..."` constant with `_compute_build_mtime()` that walks `inventory-hub/{app.py,static,templates}` for the newest mtime. Server renders `build YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`; a DOMContentLoaded hook in `scripts.html` converts to the user's local timezone via `data-build-mtime` so PDT users don't see "tomorrow" when the container clock is UTC. Regression coverage in `test_build_version_badge.py` (2 tests — local-format match + assert legacy `v154.x` literal is gone).)*

* Unknown crash on Filament command center after auto deduct fired. Had to refresh browser window to get QR code scans working? Need to check code for any breaks.

* Spools on a toolhead (yes, some how multiple are on there.) Cannot be changed once a print is started becasue the confirm change modal is being blocked, canceled, or hidden, preventing the user from swaping out filaments while a print is warming up. This wasn't intended. As I can easily forget to change a spool out during the begining of a print.

* Scanning a toolhead with multiple filaments in the command center buffer, cause all filaments to be assigned to the toolhead. This shouldn't happen. Only the top most item on the list should be assigned to the toolhead. The rest should stay in the buffer. Scan was the toolhead QR code directly (Core1-M0).

*(L130 — Location search box should show all locations after selection — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session A (item 10.10). Same `wizardBindCombobox` fix as 10.2; mirror behavior added to `promptEditLocation` Force-Location dialog. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

* Constantly being prompted that a filament or spool is verified every scan on the activity log, is a bit much, we need a way to tone that down some, or as I hate to say it, possibly turn it off. We should have another way for the user to verify this. Instead of continuing to notifying them in the Activity Log.

* Forcing a location using the location edit in the spool display modal, should proably update depolyed status to be off, unless the location selected is a toolhead. (Asuming toolheads are a valid target for this location update.)

* If possible, set certain text fields to only prompt with auto fill on some (perhaps none) fields. I think this might be a setible somewhere in the code to prevent a list of previously used values for showing up. Most of the time, this is just getting in the way for me. _[DONE 2026-05-12 (Group 8.4 / `feature/keyboard-nav-polish`) — Quick-Weigh suppression from Group 13 extended to 14 more inputs across 6 files: location ID/name, manual spool ID, wizard search/external/color, edit-filament hex/external query, global search/color, FilaBridge recovery delta. Free-form notes (`editfil-comment`, `vendoredit-comment`, `wiz-spool-comment`) deliberately left as default — history may help there. Regression coverage in `test_keyboard_nav_polish.py::test_autofill_suppressed_on_internal_inputs` and `test_freeform_comments_keep_browser_autofill`.]_

*(L138 — at-a-glance Printer Status widget — DONE 2026-05-13 via Group 9.3. Dashboard widget with stylized per-printer schematic (color-tinted toolhead blocks + remaining-weight bars + low-stock cue), reorderable via ▲▼ arrows, collapsible to a single inline chip strip. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

* These seem interesting, and it would be great to find a way to use this in some fassion. Just putting this here as a future thing, or as something to keep in mind.

https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy/blob/master/doc%2Fmetrics.md

* Only one of the printers (XL) is loading into the printer status section on live. Works fine on dev.

* Need to add an unknow location to the location list. I tried to add one manually, but it was a bit weird in how it displayed. I need a place to put spools that I just can't find, because they aren't where there location tag seays they are.

* Add filament sample status to the display modal, as well as the edit section. So that I can easily see if a swatch has be created for an item. Perhaps also include if a label print has been confirmed, to help trace down lagacy labels that need to be updated.

* I don't think the queue all active spools in the Filament Display modal should automatically open the print queue window, it causes firction if I also need to print a new label for the filament, or need to queue up more labels from other filaments/spools.

* Add a queue labe for a spool that was just created. in the bottom section, that becomes visible once it's created. So that I can easily queue a label from there with out having to find it in the filament spool list.

* Multiple spools share Legacy ID XX, should have an add new button if one isn't sure if any of the items on the list are the correct one.

* Back fill weight from filament modal button should show the empty spool weight being use for back fill, or we should just add that to the filament details modal. So the user doesn't have to load up the edit modal to see what the value is.

* Audit mode needs refinement possibly using the new unknow location for anything not scanned and confirmed to be in that locaiton. Also needs to be smart about virtual locations like carts where theres a cart location that contains sever shelves, as an example.

There continues to be inconsistency with switching out spools when a box slot is attached to a head, either ejecting doesn't fully clear all values, or only pulls it from the box, but not the toolhead. I have to take the new spool, assigne it to the box, remove the old spool from the box, and manually assign it to the toolhead directly. So we need to deep dive into that whole system and find out why this is still a problem. I've included the logs below to try and out line the the flow better than me trying to type it.

# **Active Backlog (Organized by Feature Area)**

## 📋 Activity Log
* Make the Activity Log more ubiquitous so it can be the authoritative feedback channel instead of toasts. Currently the log pane sits on the dashboard only — modal-heavy workflows (Location Manager, Wizard, Details) hide it, so the toast has to carry the full message + display time for the blind-scanner case. Candidate approaches (pick one, or stack them):
    - **Persistent mini-log widget**: a small scrollable strip that survives at the bottom/corner of the screen even when modals are open. Z-index above `.modal-backdrop` so it never gets covered. Shows the last N entries with category icons.
    - **"N new events" pill** in a corner that flashes when the log ticks. Click opens a compact log overlay. Same discipline as the `?` shortcuts overlay.
    - **Modal-aware docking**: while any modal is open, a condensed log bar docks to the modal itself (top or bottom of the modal body). Hides when no entries have arrived recently.
  Once the log is always visible, toast durations can drop further and we can rely on the log for the full narrative — toasts become purely "happened now" flashes.

## 🎨 UI & Theming
* Refactor the longer "strip" cards used in the Location Manager window. Merge the horizontal layout with modern grid card features without cramping the text or making the button layout look weird.
* High-Contrast Pop (White Text/colored text + Heavy Black Shadow/or similar color shadowing) - EVERYWHERE. Adaptive High-Contrast Pop (Shadows Only) on colors. Maintain existing colors, but give them a pop appropriate for their color.
* Theres a little animation and modal that appears when you add a new Slicer Profile in the Add/edit enventory wizzard. Its so nifty I want this used in other places. (I'm not sure if this is a sweetalert2 thing, or if we implemented ourselves.)


## ⌨️ Keyboard Navigation
* Audit and implement consistent keyboard navigation across the entire UI. Currently only the force location modal and wizard material/multiselect dropdowns support arrow keys, Enter, and Escape. Every modal, dropdown, list, and interactive element should have a unified keyboard interaction pattern: arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select/confirm, Escape to dismiss/go back, Tab to move between controls, and auto-focus on the primary input when a modal opens. _[PARTIAL 2026-05-12 (Group 8.1 / `feature/keyboard-nav-polish`) — full audit of 24 modals/overlays completed. Reference impls (mountOverlay-based, e.g. `weight_entry.js`, the bind-picker feeds combobox in `inv_loc_mgr.js`) already have full kb-active arrow-nav + Enter + Escape + auto-focus. `vendorEditModal` already auto-focuses on both Add and Edit paths. Delete overlays' Cancel-on-Enter (broad warning step) + Confirm-on-Enter (type-the-id step) is intentional UX. Only `locModal` actually lacked auto-focus — added: Add path focuses `#edit-id`, Edit path focuses + select()s `#edit-name`. Confirmed by `test_loc_modal_add_focuses_id_field` and `test_loc_modal_edit_focuses_name_field_and_selects`. **Focus-trap follow-up audit (2026-05-12, same session)**: Derek raised concern that Tab could leak from a modal into background modals or browser chrome. Probed every modal in single, stacked, and modal-on-offcanvas configurations (incl. `spoolModal` / `filamentModal` with their custom Escape handler bypassing `data-bs-keyboard`). All 16 surfaces correctly trap Tab and Shift+Tab via Bootstrap's `_enforceFocus`; topmost modal owns focus when stacked; Escape dismisses every surface. Could NOT reproduce the leak Derek saw — possible explanations: fixed by inv_core.js z-index stacking work, browser-specific (probe is Chromium), or a browser-level shortcut (Ctrl+Tab) that Playwright's `Tab` doesn't simulate. Locked the current correct behavior in with `test_modal_focus_trap.py` (19 tests covering single-modal trap, modal-on-modal stacking, modal-on-offcanvas, custom-Escape paths, auto-focus landing target). If the leak resurfaces, capture exact key combo + which modals are open before refreshing.]_

## 🗂️ Modals & Add Inventory Wizard
* Help button to provide information on how to use a modal, and to try and store information about how things work in the code.
*(L192 — Maintain multi-spool creation ability — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session A (item 10.7). No code change required; verified via existing `test_wizard_per_spool_scan_*` suite that the qty-driven row sync still works after the Session A changes. See `completed-archive.md`.)*
* Create an assignment tool/system to pair existing/migrated Spoolman IDs directly to physical legacy spools being updated (specifically for bulk-imported identical spools sharing a single legacy ID).
*(L162 — Consolidate duplicate purchase link fields — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session B (item 10.4). Single spool-tab `wiz-spool-purchase_url` with smart-fallback placeholder advertising the inherited filament URL; `wizardReset` now also clears `input[type="url"]` (the "doesn't clear between usages" bug). See `completed-archive.md`.)*
*(L163 — Slicer profile auto-add to current filament — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session B (item 10.5). New `window.wizardOnNewChoiceAdded` hook fires after the schema refresh and selects the freshly-added value on the wizard's working filament. Mirrors the existing `inv_details.js:promptEditSlicerProfile` pattern. See `completed-archive.md`.)*
*(L164 — Spoolman field ordering bug — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session B (item 10.6). Backend `FIELD_ORDER` constant + `_enrich_field_order` in `app.py` stamps each field dict with a canonical order index; the wizard's pre-existing `.sort((a,b) => (a.order||0) - (b.order||0))` now actually works. Unknown keys pin to 9999 (end). See `completed-archive.md`.)*
*(L165 — SweetAlert2 nested modal audit — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session B (item 10.8). All three `Swal.fire` sites in `inv_wizard.js` (unsaved-changes confirm, field-sync picker, add-new-choice prompt) migrated to `window.mountOverlay()`. Closes the `.cmd-deck` scrollbar-shift symptom on the unsaved-changes prompt. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

## ⚡ Quick-Swap Enhancements
*(L208 — Denser `SpoolCardBuilder` cards inside the Quick-Swap grid — DONE 2026-05-13 via Group 9.1. New `'quickswap'` variant + adopted in `inv_quickswap.js`; action footer integrates Details/Edit/Queue/Eject directly from each bound slot. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

* **[Polish] Slot-render-order radio button arrows are inconsistent and confusing.** In the Feeds editor for a Dryer Box ([modals_loc_mgr.html:243-245](inventory-hub/templates/components/modals_loc_mgr.html#L243)) the two radio buttons read `← Left → Right` (one arrow each side, pointing different directions) and `Right → Left →` (both arrows pointing right). The asymmetry and conflicting directions make it hard to glance at and know which option is currently selected vs. what the other does. Suggested cleanup: pick a single consistent pattern, e.g. `→ Left to Right` and `← Right to Left` (one arrow per button, pointing in the visual direction of slot numbering). Or drop arrows entirely and just use `1 → N` / `N → 1`. Five-minute fix; just needs a design call on which form reads cleanest.

*(L218 — Shortcuts overlay click-through — DONE 2026-05-14 via `feature/buglist-sweep-2026-05-14`. Added `#fcc-shortcuts-overlay-backdrop` sibling at z-index 10000 (just below the panel's 10001) with `onclick="toggleShortcutsOverlay()"`. `toggleShortcutsOverlay` shows/hides both elements together. Regression coverage in `test_quickswap_ui_e2e.py::test_shortcuts_overlay_backdrop_dismisses_overlay`. Existing button + `?`-key toggle tests still pass.)*

## 📍 Location Management & Scanning
* **[CRITICAL DESIGN — blocks Project Color Loadout]** Make the Location Manager less brittle and more concrete. The current model is held together by string-prefix tricks and synthesis heuristics, not real entity relationships:
  - **Printer is not a real entity.** `🦝 Core One Upgraded` exists nowhere on disk — it's conjured at runtime by grouping toolhead LocationIDs whose prefix splits the same way (`CORE1-M0`, `CORE1-M1`, … → synthetic `CORE1` with friendly name pulled from `printer_map.printer_name`). This session's regression proved how fragile that is: a stale `XL` parent row with `Type: ""` made the whole synthesizer skip and "🦝 Core One Upgraded" rendered under "Unassigned virtual storage" until I patched the synthesizer to also seed from `printer_map`.
  - **Hierarchy is encoded in strings, not data.** `LR-MDB-1` packs Room (`LR`), device class (`MDB`), and instance (`1`) into one barcode. Moving a portable box (PM/PJ class) to a new room would require renaming, which destroys the printed barcode. Today every consumer that wants to walk the tree calls `loc.split('-')[0]` — there are at least a dozen such call sites. One typo per row corrupts the entire dashboard rendering (proven this session twice).
  - **No formal Toolhead → Printer parentage.** `printer_map` lives in `config.json`, separate from `locations.json`'s toolhead rows. The two are joined by exact uppercase string match on LocationID. Drift between the two files (one has CORE1-M0/M1, other doesn't) silently breaks deduction + grouping. The MMU M0/M1 alias dedup we shipped this sweep is itself a heuristic patching that drift.
  - **Loaders fail silently.** Pre-bug-2 fix, `load_locations_list()` returned `[]` on JSONDecodeError and the dashboard rendered with no Names / Types / Grouping — the user blamed a feature commit. We loud-failed the loader, but the underlying schema is so loose that a single typo in a single string field still takes everything down. The integrity tests we added (`test_locations_json_integrity.py`) are guarding a brittle data shape, not a robust schema.

  **Concrete recommendations** for the design session:
  1. **First-class `Printer` entity in `locations.json`** with: `id`, `printer_name` (the user-facing label, owns the emoji), `model`, `mmu_attached: bool`, `prusalink_creds_ref`. Replace the synthesizer entirely.
  2. **`parent_id` foreign key on every row** (toolhead → printer; dryer-box-slot → toolhead; box → room or printer). Retire `loc.split('-')[0]` site-by-site. Once retired, a typo in a string field can't break grouping — the FK is the truth.
  3. **Decouple the printed barcode from the hierarchy.** Barcodes become opaque IDs (e.g. `B7DK29`) — the hierarchy lives in `parent_id`. A `PM` box can move rooms without re-printing.
  4. **Move `printer_map` into `locations.json`.** A Printer row owns a `toolheads: [{id, position, mmu_routed: bool}]` list. Eliminates the cross-file drift class entirely. The MMU alias problem dissolves: a Printer with `mmu_attached: true` has exactly one toolhead per position; alias rows go away.
  5. **Schema validation on write, not just on read.** `save_locations_list` rejects rows with missing `Type` / `parent_id` / unknown FK target. The empty-Type and orphan-parent classes cease to exist.
  6. **Migration path:** Phase 1 — introduce `parent_id` alongside prefix parsing, emit a migration that backfills FKs from existing prefix structure. Phase 2 — migrate consumers one at a time (synthesizer first, then `_resolve_active_locs_for_printer`, then `get_bindings_for_machine`, then the Location Manager UI grouping). Phase 3 — retire prefix parsing and delete the synthesizer.

  **Why this blocks Project Color Loadout** ([docs/Project-Color-Loadout/](docs/Project-Color-Loadout/)): a Loadout binds N filaments to a *specific Printer instance*. Today there is no Printer instance to bind to — only a synthesized name conjured from prefix grouping. A loadout would have nothing to anchor on; saving "Apply Loadout to 🦝 Core One Upgraded" would store a string that breaks the moment someone renames the printer in `printer_map`. Concrete schema makes loadouts trivial; without it, any loadout work pays the brittleness tax twice (once to ship, again when the loadout-to-printer link drifts).

  _[IN PROGRESS — Phase 1A shipped 2026-04-25 on `feature/locations-parent-id-phase-1a`. Subsequent phases tracked below.]_

  **Phase tracker (kept here so we don't lose the thread between sessions):**
  - [x] **Phase 1A — additive plumbing** (2026-04-25). Added `parent_id` field, `derive_parent_id_from_prefix`, `resolve_parent`, and `migrate_parent_ids_if_needed` to [locations_db.py](inventory-hub/locations_db.py); wired the startup migration into [app.py](inventory-hub/app.py) with timestamped backup; added ~15 unit tests in [test_dryer_bindings.py](inventory-hub/tests/test_dryer_bindings.py) plus 3 integrity-contract tests in [test_locations_json_integrity.py](inventory-hub/tests/test_locations_json_integrity.py). **No consumer reads `parent_id` yet** — purely sets up the data so Phases 1B/2 can migrate consumers safely.
  - [ ] **Phase 1B — first consumer migration**: replace `split('-')[0]` at [app.py:879](inventory-hub/app.py#L879) (room-occupancy parent extraction in the synthesizer) with `locations_db.resolve_parent`. Smallest possible consumer change; proves the abstraction works in production.
  - [ ] **Phase 2 — remaining backend consumer migrations**: [app.py:900](inventory-hub/app.py#L900) (synthesizer printer-prefix seed); [locations_db.py:210](inventory-hub/locations_db.py#L210) (`_known_printer_prefixes`); [logic.py:596](inventory-hub/logic.py#L596) (smart_eject room prefix); [spoolman_api.py:456,464](inventory-hub/spoolman_api.py#L456) (child-of-parent matching for spool location queries). One per commit; each gets its own integration test.
  - [ ] **Phase 2.5 — frontend consumer migrations**: [inv_core.js:407–408,498](inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js#L407) (sort + parent-row styling); [inv_loc_mgr.js:344](inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_loc_mgr.js#L344) (sentinel-option derivation). API surface stays the same; JS reads the new `parent_id` field instead of splitting LocationID.
  - [ ] **Phase 3 — first-class `Printer` rows on disk**: persist what the synthesizer at [app.py:872–958](inventory-hub/app.py#L872) currently conjures. Add `Printer` to the required-Type list in `_required_keys_for`. Migrate `printer_name` from `config.json:printer_map` into the Printer row's `Name` field. Retire the runtime synthesizer. Tighten `parent_id` validation: every non-null `parent_id` must point to a real on-disk row. **This is the phase that unblocks Project Color Loadout.**
  - [ ] **Phase 4 — fold `printer_map` into `locations.json`**: add a `toolheads` array on the Printer row carrying `position` and `mmu_routed`. Retire `config.json:printer_map`. Update `_resolve_active_locs_for_printer`, `get_bindings_for_machine`, `validate_slot_targets`, and `/api/printer_map` to read from the new shape. MMU M0/M1 alias dedup heuristic dissolves (a Printer with `mmu_attached: true` has exactly one toolhead per position).
  - [ ] **Phase 5 — retire prefix parsing**: delete `derive_parent_id_from_prefix` and the fallback inside `resolve_parent`. Remove all remaining `split('-')[0]` sites. Add write-time schema validation that rejects `save_locations_list` calls with missing or orphan `parent_id`. Decouple printed barcodes from hierarchy strings (per recommendation #3 above).

* 🔄 **Bulk Moves**: The ability to scan Box A (Source) and Shelf B (Destination) and say "Move EVERYTHING from Box A to Shelf B."
* Shapeshifting QR Codes in more places (like Audit button).

* Scanning a storage location (Any, dryerbox, Cart, etc) doesn't assign all items in the buffer to that cart, it requires you to scan the location multiple times in order to assign them all to it. _[LIKELY ALREADY FIXED — `performContextAssign` at inv_cmd.js:270 and `/api/smart_move` both accept a `spools[]` list and iterate the entire buffer. See the `[ALEX FIX] Bulk Assign` comment on inv_cmd.js:272. On next occurrence, capture the Network tab's `/api/smart_move` POST payload to confirm only one spool id was sent — if so the bug is upstream of the payload construction, in the buffer state. Otherwise close this out.]_
* Location Manager not syncing status across browser instances? _[ON HOLD — requires a real-time transport (SSE / WebSocket) on the backend. Current architecture is pull-only via `/api/locations` polling. Non-trivial; revisit after mobile mode since that work will establish the multi-client baseline anyway.]_

## 🎟️ Print Queue, Labels & Filament Usage
*(Group 3 — Print Queue & Label Management — completed 2026-04-28; see `completed-archive.md` for resolved items.)*

## 🧪 Testing
*(L263 `test_visual_quickswap_confirm_overlay` baseline mismatch — DONE 2026-05-12 via Group 14.4 — baseline re-captured at the new Group-15 mountOverlay shape. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

*(L264 `test_details_modal_interactions` offcanvas-backdrop intercept — DONE 2026-05-12 via Group 14.3 + 14.6 follow-up. Defensive teardown promoted to `conftest.reset_dom_state_js`; page-wide `.fcc-card-action-btn` scoped to `#offcanvasSearch`. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

*(Group 16 testing-hardening items — parallel `tests/` directory consolidated, `_open_manage` helper promoted to `open_manage_modal` conftest fixture (10 files migrated), `reset_dom_state_js` adopted in 6 more e2e test files, Windows pip/pytest interpreter mismatch documented — DONE 2026-05-12. See `completed-archive.md`.)*

## ⚙️ App Flow, Architecture & Database
* **MOBILE** Make the entire app mobile friendly so NFC/Scanning works on phones. (Perhaps a desktop mode to utalize barcode scanners, and a mobile mode of mostly touch interface and scanning barcodes/QR codes and NFC tags). The main difference being that mobile mode won't relye on all the inlaid barcode/qr codes we currently have in the interface currently for interacting with the UI elements.
* Refactor dashboard to be more modular if possible, and reduce token size/context requirements.
* Make as much of Command Center user configurable as possible, using UI elements and a config import/export feature.
* When changes are made to Spoolman extra fields, they usually ignore sort order in the database. We need a way to restore sort order.
* **Clean up filament attributes** — remove dead/duplicate entries from the `filament_attributes` choice list, AND add input validation so new garbage entries can't be created in the first place. _[2026-04-28 audit: Spoolman is the source of truth (CSVs no longer authoritative). Total 34 choices on the field; 27 actually used across 180 filaments. Spoolman's API rejects choice removal via POST (`400 "Cannot remove existing choices."`), so a true cleanup requires the snapshot-restore migration pattern (template: `migrate_container_slot_to_text` in `setup-and-rebuild/setup_fields.py`): snapshot all filaments' `filament_attributes` values → `force_reset` delete the field schema → recreate with cleaned choices → restore filtered values. Heavy for purely cosmetic dropdown cleanup; deferred until the migration is worth the time.

  **Prevention guards — DONE 2026-05-14 via Group 10 Session B (item 10.9).** Shared `choice_validation.js` module (`normalizeChoice`, `validateNewChoice`, `levenshtein`) with all five guards from the original spec (min length ≥3, leading/trailing punctuation rejection, fuzzy/prefix/normalized-key match warning with "Did you mean?" overlay, two-step confirm before commit, live canonical preview). Hooked into the wizard's `wizardPromptNewChoice` mountOverlay (stateful content-swap stages so Escape isn't lost to a capture-phase race) AND into `wizardAddMultiChoiceChip`'s silent blur-commit path AND into `inv_details.js:addAttrChip` for parity. See `completed-archive.md`. **Bulk-cleanup migration above still deferred** — guards stop new garbage from being added; existing dead choices still need the snapshot-restore migration when prioritized.

  **Confirmed safe to delete** (Derek 2026-04-28): `Carbon-Fiber` (dupe of `Carbon Fiber`), `Tran` (truncated), `Transparent; High-Speed` (semicolon-bogus), `Wood` (superseded by `Wood Filled`), `F` (typo).
  **Keep:** `+` — represents PLA+ filaments (currently displayed as `+ PLA`, but the value itself is intentional). Filament #132 (Creality Rainbow) uses it correctly.
  **Investigate before deciding:** `For Infill` — was used to flag color-switch / prototype-only filaments not meant for visible prints. Codebase grep confirms no replacement mechanism exists; if Derek wants a different infill-flag UX, that should be a separate item. Otherwise keep.
  `Matte Pro` — likely orphaned from a prior wipe-and-replace, currently unused. Probably safe to delete but Derek wants to confirm origin first.

  **Bad data to fix** (out of scope for choice cleanup): no orphaned values found in actual records — everything stored references either a still-valid choice or `+` (intentional).

  **Approach when ready:** Write `setup-and-rebuild/migrate_filament_attributes.py` following `migrate_container_slot_to_text` template. Should be runnable from host with config_loader path setup, ask for confirmation, snapshot → force_reset → recreate → restore. Verify against a live Spoolman dev instance with backup before touching prod.]_
* Continue to support Spoolman's "Import from External" feature for filaments... _[Status of existing parsers + a gap list of unimplemented sources lives in the module docstring at the top of `inventory-hub/external_parsers.py` as of 2026-05-13 (Group 11). The audit + dropdown cleanup landed; the items below are the still-unimplemented sources.]_
    - open-filament-database
    - Prusament spool specific data links
    - Open Print Tags (Initialize, Read, and Write)
* Maybe we should figure out a way to set up a dev version for Spoolman and filabridge.
* Change auto refresh to be a pause button instead for live activity.
* Need to add a routine to clean up the logs after a while.
* Refactoring setup code to be dynamic. On brand new installs, maintain existing code to get it started.
* Continue to support Spoolman's ability to pull data from the vendor up to filament (Empty Weight), and from Filament to Spool (price, etc.)
* Add the ability to configure which extra fields should be bound and propagated to the other type of item. (Filament <-> Spool).
* Spools might need to have a text field added to store the product data (Prusament link, etc.).
* Add background refreshing used in Location Manager, etc... to update spool text (update weight other data).
* Python server auto-reload on new code changes.


# **On Hold**
* Amazon Parser: Multi-pack spools with different colors (e.g. 4x1kg) currently calculate as a single 4000g spool instead of 4 individual 1000g spools.
* `test_amazon_parser_matching` is failing — BeautifulSoup4 is not installed in the Docker container. Parser returns empty results because the import fails silently. Blocked until `pip install beautifulsoup4` is added to the Docker image. Found during structural test fix work (4/15/2026).
* Continue to support Spoolman's "Import from External" feature... Purchase emails, or Amazon/Vendor product pages, Onlyspoolz.com.
* Standardize the size of all QR codes to match that of the sizes used on the command center. (Audit, eject, drop, etc).
* If legacy barcode has no spools attached to it, UI should warn about this, perhaps give option to add new spool?
* Spoolman ExternalID is not a visible field in Spoolman UI. Very low priority.
* A way to compare the specs of two filaments side by side.


# **Overarching Issue**
I think we've inadvertently created 3 levels of logic/complexity here:
1. The physical, Scanning stuff and efficiently Moving it
2. A UI layer, for debugging, but should only really need to be looked at to confirm things
3. A full on interface that is easier to move spools around than having to use Spoolman's lackluster interface.
All 3 of these things are important and have value. We should table for now, and come back to once we've gotten more of the functionality in place.

## Stuff to watch ##

# ** Filabridge Error Recovery **
* Keep an eye on filabridge errors and note the type of recovery method used to fill in the missing weight data. (Fast-Fetch or RAM-Fetch) To see if Fast-Fetch (Based on a HTTP Range request of a file.) works.
* **Filabridge ↔ Spoolman reconcile utility.** Admin action (button in Config or a top-bar widget) that reads `/api/status` from filabridge and cross-checks every non-zero toolhead mapping against Spoolman's `location` field. For each mismatch, offer two choices: (a) "Trust Spoolman — unmap filabridge" (clears the stale entry) or (b) "Trust filabridge — update Spoolman" (writes the toolhead into Spoolman's `location`). Today this is fixable only via a manual Python one-liner (see `acf309c` / `efa15dd` discussion 2026-04-22). The new `_fb_spool_location()` pre-flight in `logic.py` prevents *new* desyncs, but doesn't heal ghost mappings created by earlier bugs, manual DB edits, or the retired `suppress_fb_unmap` code path — once a ghost exists, it persists until the affected spool gets moved through the fixed path.

# **New related project to be integrated **
