# Complete Changelog & Walkthrough

## Multi-Color Swatches in Live Activity
- Users reported that multi-color filaments did not render correctly in the "Live Activity" log window. 
- Using dynamic string parsing in [state.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_state.py), Spoolman's comma-separated multi-hex strings are now dynamically rendered into mathematically equivalent CSS `conic-gradient` pizzas. 
- E.g., a two-color filament translates to `background: conic-gradient(#color1 0% 50%, #color2 50% 100%)`.

## Undo Buffer Restoration: Fix Walkthrough

### Issue Overview
Users reported that after moving an item from the "Buffer" into a location, triggering an "Undo" action successfully removed the item from the location in the Spoolman DB, but failed to restore the item visibly into the user's active UI Buffer.

We identified three separate issues that contributed to this bug across the stack.

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Backend Origin Tracking ([logic.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_logic.py) & [app.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/app.py))
- We modified [app.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/app.py)'s `/api/manage_contents` and `/api/smart_move` endpoints to securely process and forward an `origin='buffer'` string whenever an API request was initialized from the frontend's buffer zone.
- We updated [logic.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_logic.py)'s [perform_smart_move](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/logic.py#120-222) to explicitly intercept the `origin` flag and pass it downwards into the `UNDO_STACK` history record.
- We updated [perform_undo()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/logic.py#258-307) to monitor popped `UNDO_STACK` actions, intercept cases where `origin == 'buffer'`, and safely inject the reversed spools back into `state.GLOBAL_BUFFER`.

#### 2. Frontend Buffer Tag Extraction ([inv_cmd.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js) & [inv_loc_mgr.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_loc_mgr.js))
- We corrected [performContextAssign](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#233-261) inside [inv_cmd.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js) to ensure rapid bulk-scans from the dashboard correctly appended the `origin: 'buffer'` JSON payload.
- We corrected [inv_loc_mgr.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_loc_mgr.js)'s [doAssign()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_loc_mgr.js#527-569) and [handleSlotInteraction()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_loc_mgr.js#476-526) so that dragging, dropping, and replacing items correctly propagated the `isFromBuffer` flag over the network.

#### 3. Asynchronous Data-Race Mutex ([inv_cmd.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js))
- Even after the backend and frontend payloads correctly identified and stored buffer restorations, the UI would still load empty.
- **The Cause:** [triggerUndo()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#262-263) called [loadBuffer()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#331-353), which fetched the newly repaired array and triggered [renderBuffer()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#4-77). [renderBuffer()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#4-77) was fundamentally designed to *always* call [persistBuffer()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#322-330) (which immediately uploads the UI state back to the server to prevent data loss). 
- Because of Javascript's async execution speeds, the system would request the old buffer, download the new array, but instantly upload an empty array `[]` *back* to the server before the variables fully settled, resulting in infinite rollback loops.
- **The Fix:** We injected an `isBufferSyncing` boolean mutex. [loadBuffer](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#331-353) sets this to `true` when downloading, preventing [persistBuffer](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#322-330) from executing an upload until the current render cycle completes fully.

### Results
- Moving spools out of the buffer, into slots (both empty and occupied), and undoing those actions now cleanly restores the precise UI state. Automatic Toolhead Ejections are successfully reversed asynchronously alongside buffer restorations without collisions.
- Pytest cases were added in [test_logic.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_logic.py) to ensure core buffer tracking logic persists across Python environments correctly.

## Scanner Paused Click Eater
- The user reported that clicking the browser window to awaken it while the `#focus-guard` overlay was active caused the browser's hardware `mousedown` event to register on the command buttons underneath the overlay, unintentionally triggering actions.
- Investigated and found that Javascript event interceptors (capturing phase) were failing because the OS-level `focus` event resolves *before* the hardware mouse events, causing the script to instantly hide the `#focus-guard` and surrender the click.
- Implemented a CSS-driven physical shield inside [scripts.html](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/templates/components/scripts.html):
  - When the window loses focus, the `#focus-guard` turns on.
  - When the window regains focus, the `#focus-guard` instantly flips to `opacity: 0` so it immediately disappears for the user.
  - However, a `setTimeout` ensures it physically remains at `display: flex` for `150ms`.
  - This guarantees the `touchstart`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and [click](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_details.js#134-137) hardware events strike the invisible shield instead of the buttons underneath it, completely eating the mis-click natively without JS event propagation.

## Command Deck Auto-Disarm
- The user reported that clicking a danger mode like "Eject" and then opening a different screen (like the Location Manager) resulted in the Eject mode dangerously staying active in the background.
- Added a new `window.resetCommandModes()` function to [inv_cmd.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js) that forcibly disarms `state.dropMode` and `state.ejectMode`, removing the red/orange highlights from the UI.
- Injected a global Javascript listener into [scripts.html](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/templates/components/scripts.html) that triggers on the Bootstrap event `show.bs.modal`.
- Now, opening *any* modal screen automatically intercepts the navigation and instantly disarms the main dashboard deck in the background, making it safe to operate.
- Added a Python-based syntax unit test [test_frontend.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_frontend.py) to ensure the hook logic exists.

## Native Background UI Live-Refresh ([liveRefreshBuffer](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js#354-412) & `liveRefreshLocationManager`)
- The user requested that modifying a spool's attributes (like weight or color) inside Spoolman should automatically push those updates to the Command Center UI without requiring a hard refresh or stealing focus.
- **Backend Infrastructure:**
  - Built a new highly-optimized endpoint `POST /api/spools/refresh` in [app.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/app.py). Given a list of Spool IDs, it bypasses the standard grid logic and executes rapid queries directly to Spoolman to fetch just those specific objects, formats them via [format_spool_display()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/spoolman_api.py#72-133), and returns a dictionary payload.
  - Wrote a new Pytest asserting [get_live_spools_data](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/logic.py#376-396) returns the correct attributes.
- **Frontend Dashboard Sync ([inv_cmd.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_cmd.js)):**
  - Tapped into the existing `inventory:sync-pulse` heartbeat (which fires every 5 seconds) to harvest the IDs of all Spools currently sitting in `state.heldSpools`.
  - Sent the array to the backend and mapped the returned styling natively onto the DOM.
  - **Surgical DOM Updates:** Rather than executing `updateQueueUI()` (which destroys and rebuilds the HTML, causing the browser to drop cursors and flashing the screen), we injected `data-spool-id` attributes onto the Buffer `cham-card` and `nav-card` elements themselves. The Javascript now directly uses `document.querySelectorAll()` to locate the active nodes and organically mutates `.innerText` and `background-color`, providing a perfectly smooth user experience.
- **Location Manager Sync ([inv_loc_mgr.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_loc_mgr.js)):**
  - Removed the aggressive legacy [refreshManageView()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_loc_mgr.js#70-97) function from the heartbeat listener.
  - Upgraded both the Grid View and List View rendering loops to tag elements with `data-spool-id` IDs.
  - Implemented an intelligent parser that sweeps the `#manageModal` when the Pulse fires, aggregates every visible Spool ID, and uses the exact same backend engine to perform surgical, focus-safe updates to the Location Modal's text and badge elements.

## WakeLock Polyfill (Screen Sleep Prevention)
- The user reported that the [requestWakeLock()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js#33-54) API implementation inside [inv_core.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js) frequently failed on laptops, causing the Command Center dashboard to fall asleep during long active sessions.
- **Root Cause:** Modern browsers (specifically Chromium engines on battery power) enforce rigid power-saving heuristics that silently deny or break pure Javascript `wakeLock.request('screen')` promises natively.
- **The Fix:** Integrated `NoSleep.js`, the industry-standard media fallback polyfill. 
- Modified [requestWakeLock](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js#33-54) to first attempt the native Web API, but immediately bind an invisible, muted `<video>` injection loop to the HTML DOM.
- Upon the user's first physical interaction with the page (click or touch), the `noSleep.enable()` loop silently plays a 1-pixel video, which completely bypasses the browser's restrictions and forces the OS to recognize an active media session, permanently blocking sleep.
- Wrote Pytest assertions to actively verify the injection tag inside [scripts.html](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/templates/components/scripts.html) and the invocation logic within [inv_core.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js).

## Black Filament Borders
- The user reported that pure black filaments (`#000000`) completely vanish against the Dashboard's `#222` dark mode background plating.
- Modified the recursive [getFilamentStyle()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js#102-162) math engine located in [inv_core.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js).
- During the hex-parsing phase, the engine now extracts the absolute RGB coordinates of the calculated filament. If all three values (Red, Green, Blue) register strictly under `35` (e.g., `#111111` or `#000000`), the engine dynamically inserts a `border: 2px solid #666` property into the payload context.
  - Modified `.cham-card`, `.nav-card`, and [getFilamentStyle](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_core.js#102-162) downstream consumers (Buffer lists, Location Modals, Detail Modals) to intelligently intercept the `border` key from the dictionary.
  - If present, the DOM elements are organically painted with a `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px #555` to dynamically carve out a crisp contrast border exclusively for the darkest spools.

## Suppressed System Daemon Log Growth (Flask Telemetry)
- The user reported that production logs were growing endlessly "out of hand" without a cleanup routine.
- An investigation into [state.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_state.py) proved that the primary system logger ([hub.log](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/hub.log)) actually already natively enforces an aggressive `RotatingFileHandler` permanently caching the output to a strict 5MB maximum file size limit.
- **Root Cause:** The actual offender causing infinite server disk expansion was Flask's underlying `werkzeug` HTTP engine. Every 2.5 seconds, the Dashboard pings `/api/logs` and `/api/state/buffer`. Flask natively prints these `HTTP 200` networking requests directly to `stdout`. Production daemons (like `systemd`) intercept `stdout` and write it to disk indefinitely.
- **The Fix:** Injected `logging.getLogger('werkzeug').setLevel(logging.ERROR)` directly into the initialization layer of [app.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/app.py).
  - This surgically silences routing telemetry and status codes from printing to the console entirely, instantly stopping infinite log bloat at the source without wiping out actual crash data or custom `InventoryHub` warnings.

## Test Suite Architecture Fixes (Pytest)
- During the validation checks for the logging update, a massive chain of `Pytest` failures occurred within [test_state.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_state.py) and [test_logic.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_logic.py), seemingly disconnected from the log suppression edits.
- Traced the `AttributeError: DummyState` crashes back to a global module hijack inside [test_locations_db.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_locations_db.py) (`sys.modules['state'] = DummyState()`). 
- **The Fix:** Deleted the hostile system override and natively patched [test_locations_db.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_locations_db.py) to securely isolate its mocking through standard Python import protocols. The entire testing suite (17 tests) is fully green and restored.

## Unassigned Location QR Bug
- The user reported that scanning `LOC:UNASSIGNED` to send buffer spools directly into the "Unassigned" bucket via a QR code was failing. 
- **Root Cause (Backend API):** Traced the frontend and backend string parsing sequences. When the scanner captured `UNASSIGNED`, the application successfully evaluated it and triggered a [perform_smart_move(target='UNASSIGNED')](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/logic.py#120-222). However, the final hand-off from [spoolman_api.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_spoolman_api.py) natively uploaded `{"location": "UNASSIGNED"}`. Spoolman strictly rejects this literal string; to logically release an item into the unassigned ether, Spoolman requires an exact empty JSON string `""`. 
- **The Fix:** Injected an interceptor cleanly into [update_spool()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/spoolman_api.py#53-71) inside [spoolman_api.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_spoolman_api.py). Before firing the `PATCH` request, the Python handler evaluates the target string. If it organically equals the word `"UNASSIGNED"`, the string is immediately destroyed and coerced into `""`, achieving a seamless physical unassignment while allowing all logging and dashboard notifications to still say `"UNASSIGNED"`.
- **Root Cause (Scanner Parsing):** The user was still receiving "Unknown code (Use Loc: prefix)" because their generated QR code completely lacked the `LOC:` prefix. [app.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/app.py) failed to generate `LOC:UNASSIGNED` natively because "Unassigned" isn't a physical location in `locations.json`, so the print generator rejected the request. When scanning the raw string `UNASSIGNED`, [logic.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_logic.py)'s legacy fallback block checked the physical database allowed-list and crashed.
- **The Fix:** Hardcoded `"UNASSIGNED"` into [logic.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_logic.py)'s valid string fallback list so it routes safely without crashing. Then, modified [api_print_location_label()](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/app.py#548-663) in [app.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/app.py) to artificially mock `loc_data` if `target_id == "UNASSIGNED"`, restoring the frontend's ability to seamlessly generate and print a valid `LOC:UNASSIGNED` barcode natively from the Location Manager.

## Product Data Linking
- Added a dedicated Spool-level `product_url` field to store unique data like Prusament spool tracker sheets that shouldn't be bound generically to an overarching Filament definition.
- **Database Initialization:** Updated [setup_fields.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/setup-and-rebuild/setup_fields.py) to safely inject the `product_url` text field variable into Spoolman's physical entities database schema without dropping historical values. Modified the script to dynamically import `config_loader` and resolve the correct Spoolman URL structurally from [config.json](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/config.json).
- **API Formatter:** Modified [spoolman_api.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_spoolman_api.py)'s `JSON_STRING_FIELDS` constant list to natively sweep `product_url` payloads and safely wrap them in explicit double-quotes when executing Spoolman HTTP `PATCH` requests to avoid `400 Invalid JSON` errors. Wrote new Pytest [test_spoolman_api.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/tests/test_spoolman_api.py) to validate this payload sanitization function natively.
- **Historical Migration Utility:** Engineered a custom Python script ([setup-and-rebuild/migrate_spool_links.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/setup-and-rebuild/migrate_spool_links.py)) to scrape all existing spools in the local database. Modified to dynamically pull target database configurations via `config_loader`. The script systematically uses Regex to identify and lift any legacy `http` URLs out of the raw [comment](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/setup-and-rebuild/migrate_spool_links.py#15-36) box string, deletes the URL from the comment memory, and pushes the payload into the brand new dedicated `extra.product_url` database column seamlessly. Executed this across the user's DB successfully pulling multiple Prusament IDs.
- **UI Details Implementation:** Added a dynamic, hidden container chunk (`<div id="detail-product-url-container">`) into the `spoolModal` framework inside [modals_details.html](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/templates/components/modals_details.html). Edited [inv_details.js](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/inventory-hub/static/js/modules/inv_details.js) to look for the `d.extra.product_url` field during payload population. If the tracker link string exists, the javascript rips the JSON bounding quotes, sets the target `href` for the HTML anchor tag, and natively toggles the CSS to display an interactive `🔗 View Product Data` button natively above the comment section in the Spool Details modal pop-up.

## Automated Update Script Safeguards
- The user's production environment strictly relies on a TrueNAS cron job targeting [update.sh](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/update.sh) to execute git pulls and `midclt` restart sequences.
- **Spoolman DB Safeguard:** Hooked a new block natively into the bash update hook that evaluates [config.json](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/config.json) via a one-line Python script, maps the Spoolman server IP organically, and drops a strict `curl -sSf` POST request natively against Spoolman's API-level Backup generation endpoint. 
- **Graceful Failure & Alerting:** If `curl` reads a non-200 code (signifying the Spoolman backup failed), [update.sh](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/update.sh) immediately intercepts the error, bypasses the Git code pull, triggers `exit 1` to safeguard the environment against touching bad databases, and uses TrueNAS's `midclt call mail.send` API stack to dispatch an urgent administrator email directly highlighting the backup failure and manual intervention requirements.
- **Migrations Automation:** The script physically executes the [setup_fields.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/setup-and-rebuild/setup_fields.py) schema injection and [migrate_spool_links.py](file:///d:/My%20Documents/Documents/3D%20Printing/Filament%20Command%20Center/setup-and-rebuild/migrate_spool_links.py) database sweep using Python 3 after successfully completing the `git reset --hard` but immediately *before* executing the TrueNAS `app.start` API wrapper. This comprehensively ensures that when code logically relies on new data nodes like `product_url`, they organically exist in the physical Docker runtime.
